## Reactive Programming

Reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change.

Declarative -> this is what I want to happen

Imperative -> Specifying all the steps

With this paradigm, it's possible to express static (e.g arrays) or dynamic
(e.g event emitters) data streams with ease, and also communicate that an inferred dependency within the associated
execution model exists

### Traditional use cases

1. User events
    1. When user clicks a button -> reacting to a button click, do something when the button is clicked.
    2. When I/O response happens.
2. Something

### Why do we need Reactive Programming?

A mordern application development is characterized by

1. High data scale
2. High usage scale
3. Cloud based costs

##### Types of scaling

1. Vertical scaling -> Increase processor capacity (e.g memory)
2. Horizontal scaling-> adding more servers

Before scaling, we need to optimize

### Reactive Programming is:-

- A different way of thinking about flow
- A different way of thinking about data
- Integrated with Java! 'Flow' interface
